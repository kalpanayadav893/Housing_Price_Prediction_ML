# ðŸ’³ Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a loan application will be **approved or rejected** based on applicant details and financial information.  
It applies **Decision Tree**, **Naive Bayes**, and **Random Forest** classifiers to perform prediction and compares their performance.
